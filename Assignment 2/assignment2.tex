\section{Linear and Binary Searches}
\subsection{Linear Search}
A linear search is one of the most flexible search algorithms. The only requirement of this search is that
the collection of elements can be traversed and checked for equality. This algorithm simply goes through
each element and checks for equality. This algorithm works in linear time big oh of n because in the worse
case it checks every element for equality.
\subsection{Binary Search}
For a binary search to be applicable, the collection must be sorted (therefore of comparable elements)
and random access. An array of sorted elements is the most common data type in which a binary search
can be done on. An array is random access because an element can be accessed at any time with its
given index.\\
\newline
This algorithm works with the following process: (1) picking the midpoint of its bounds;
(2) check equality between midpoint value and target if equal, element is found;
(3) check whether midpoint value is greater/ lesser than target then set lower / upper bound to
midpoint -1 / +1 and repeat to step 1 if the upper bound does is not equal or lower than the lower bound. 
How the bounds change also depends on if the array is in ascending or descending order.
The following is a code example of binary search on an ascending array.
\section{Hash Table Search}
\subsection{Overview}
For a hash table search to be implemented the data has to be stored in well... a hash table. A hash table maps
a value to a key with a hash function. In an array implementation the key would be an index. A hash function
should be able to hash an indefinite number of inputs depending only on the constraints of the data type. 
Ideally this mapping is 1 to 1, but practically mapping an indefinite number of inputs to a key also requires
an indefinite amount of space to store the value at each given key. Thus, there may be collisions
where values map to the same key; this will have to be dealt with through storing a collection at each key
which can dynamically increase in size such as a linked list. The search process of a hash table is
hashing the target value then going to its collection and finding or not finding (usually through a linear search)
the target in the chain.
\subsection{A Perfect Hash Function}
A perfect hash function maps every valid value as a unique key. As an exercise, let's see how many keys
are needed to create a perfect hash function for 8 bit ascii strings. Each ascii character
has $2^8$ or 256 different possibilities. So, if the hash function only hashes
a single ascii character it will need 256 different keys. If the valid input is extended each
additional character will multiply the number of different keys needed by 256 because there will be an
additional 256 valid strings for each already existing combination. To be able to hash length 8
strings there will need to be $256^8$ or $2^{64}$ keys. Each key will need 8 bytes
(for instance, numbers 0 through $2^{64}-1$) of information 
to store its position; it will also need an additional bit to store whether it exists in
the hash table (it will not need to store the string itself because that can be obtained from the key).
In total, this hash table will be $65 * 2^{64}$ bits. This is about 150 \textit{exabytes}. The amount
of storage -- \textit{not even working memory} -- in all of the world's computer is estimated to be about double that. So, it is safe to say:
prefect hashes are impractical for hash tables.

Guy: \textit{Great! Then we'll spend more time together.}\\
Girl: \textit{What?}\\
Guy: \textit{It's a classic tradeoff: space versus time. "Taking space" will allow us to spend more time together}.\\

\subsection{Sample Hash Function}
The following is an example of an imperfect hash that has hashSize keys (250 for later examples). This maps any string
into an integer from 0 to hashSize-1. It does this through summing the ascii values (treating and alphabetical character as uppercase)
and multiplying by a large prime and the finding the reminder after dividing by the hashSize. This modulo operation ensures the any arbitrarily
large product is converted to an integer in the correct bounds. Multiplication by a large prime is done to spread the results across the keys.
This a common technique as many hashing methods having trends in the added values that can result in trends in the indexes.
\subsection{Sample Add Implementation}
A hash table can be implemented with an array which is the same size as the amount of keys. In this implementation
both an array for the heads of the linked list and the tails is created to ensure constant time $O(1)$ adding even if
the hash function maps to the same index every time. Other implementations of adding to a hash table may have a 
factor of the chain length of each index; a possible advantage could be ensuring each value is only stored once.
This factor is often called the load factor or $\alpha$; it can
be calculated by dividing the amount of elements added to the hash table by the amount of keys.
In the above case adding would be $O(1 + \alpha)$ \\
\newline
\noindent
The following code adds to the linked list at the tail much like an enqueue from a queue.
